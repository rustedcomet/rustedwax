# On-chain format

The exact `custom_json` written to Hive, how artist and title are derived, and how `kind` is
decided.

## On-chain format

Identical to the extension — do not change these without changing the indexers:

- `custom_json` id: `hive_scrobble_ai`
- authority: `required_posting_auths: [<username>]`
- `app`: `hivescrobblesai/1.0`
- Payload: [`HiveScrobblePayload`](https://github.com/Holozing1/hivescrobble/blob/master/src/core/scrobbler/hive/hive.types.ts)

Scrobble rules, from `hive-scrobbler.ts#finalize`, with one deliberate deviation:

- **Song / video** — 1 tx at the configured threshold (60% by default). Mobile
  has no dedicated podcast payload path.
- **Songs only** — a 2nd tx at ≥160% (a genuine double-listen), capped at 2. Upstream doubles every
  kind; RustedWax caps non-song kinds and every `/shorts/` viewing at one tx. The path cap matters
  even when a music Short is correctly classified as `song`, because the browser still auto-loops it.
- **Movie / episode** — 1 tx at ≥80%. *Not implemented on mobile* (see Limitations).
- **Minimum length: 30 s**, or **10 s for a verified short**. Not upstream — added because YouTube
  pre-roll ads publish their own media session carrying the *video's* title and a ~6-second
  duration, which would otherwise scrobble the song on every ad. Pre-roll is a watch-page
  phenomenon, and field data confirmed the floor was rejecting only shorts and never a watch-path
  track, so shorts get their own floor. See "Short clips" below.
- **A continuous looping video still produces at most one scrobble.** An observed playback-position
  reset from the final 20% of an item to its first 20% is logged as a detected loop and caps that
  continuous viewing to one transaction even when its payload kind is `song`. Progress above 125%
  on a verified short remains a fallback probable-loop diagnostic. Neither signal erases the
  qualifying first viewing. A separate later session earns its own new
  scrobble; the inherited ≥160% branch only applies when no loop/reset evidence
  was observed.
- **Progress is measured in content, not clock time.** Played time is scaled by the playback rate,
  because it's compared against `duration`. Watching a 76-second trailer to the end at 1.25× is
  100%, not the 67% of wall-clock that elapsed — and at 2× a fully-watched video used to read 50%
  and never scrobble at all.
- `now_playing` is never broadcast on-chain.

### Artist and title

`Artist - Track` splitting is a **music** operation — it asserts the text left of the dash names a
performer. So it only runs for `kind: song`. For a `kind: video` entry the **channel is the artist**
and the **whole title is the title**, unsplit.

That distinction is not cosmetic. Before v0.8.0 a film trailer went on-chain as
`artist: "Fall 2: Deadpoint (2026) Official Trailer 2"` with `title: "Harriet Slater, Arsema
Thomas"` — a film name in the artist field and a cast list in the title.

A trailing run of hashtags is stripped from either kind (`Rüyamda seni gördüm #dizi #blutv` →
`Rüyamda seni gördüm`). Interior hashtags are kept, because `Song #2 of the series` is doing work.
Beyond tidiness: the tag run used to be part of the title, so the same clip reposted with different
tags counted as a different listen and landed twice.

Other shapes the parser understands, several adapted from the desktop extension: `Artist "Track"`,
`Track (by Artist)`, a leading `[genre]` tag as noise, and album/vinyl track numbers (`03.`, `A1.`).
A leading **CJK** bracket is the opposite — `【Bring Me The Horizon】…` names the *artist*, which is
where the guitar-cover bug that started Phase 4 was fixed.

`album` is populated for Art Tracks, read from the fixed shape of an auto-generated description
(`Provided to YouTube by …` / `Song · Artist` / `Album`). Never guessed from a hand-written
description, and never set on a video.

### How `kind` is decided

Evidence, strongest first — a stronger layer always beats a weaker one:

0. **Auto-generated provenance** → song, above every title rule: music.youtube.com, a `- Topic`
   channel, or a description beginning *"Provided to YouTube by …"*. These are distributor feeds —
   the title is catalogue metadata, not a human description — so title heuristics don't apply.
   It's why a game soundtrack's track called `Tutorial` or `Trailer 2` stays music.
0b. **A title that is only hashtags** → video, whatever the category says. `#guitar #dubstep #fnaf`
   names no work, and a song entry that names no track is permanent playlist debt. Below real
   provenance because a distributor feed's title is catalogue metadata and never looks like this.
1. **Format evidence** → video, beating even the category (uploaders do categorize tutorials and
   music-news bulletins as *Music*): podcast / how-to / gameplay / review titles, `Official
   Trailer`, music-news headlines (`… Releases New Single …`), TV episode numbering
   (`Season 6 Ep 19`, `S06E19`, `11x24` — but not music's `EP 2`, nor `1920x1080`/`16x9`),
   clip channels (`… Movies`, `… Cinema`),
   game playthroughs without an instrument.
2. **The YouTube Music catalogue** (needs "Look videos up") → song. Keyed by video id, so it
   answers where a string-matched lookup can't — most Spanish-language and small-channel uploads
   in field testing. Positive-only: indie, live and personal-channel uploads simply aren't in the
   catalogue, so absence is never evidence *against* music.
   `MUSIC_VIDEO_TYPE_PODCAST_EPISODE` is explicitly excluded: being present in YouTube Music does
   not turn a podcast—or a timer mislabelled as one—into a song.
3. **YouTube's `Music` category** (needs "Look videos up") → song.
4. **A MusicBrainz match** on artist + recording → song.
5. **Commentary words that are also song titles** (`reaction`, `tutorial`, `interview`, `episode`,
   `Trailer 2`) → video — below provenance and MusicBrainz on purpose, so "Chain Reaction" and a
   soundtrack's "Tutorial" are rescued while the video formats are caught.
6. **Cover / playthrough vocabulary** → song, when instrument-qualified. Below the words above,
   because "Bass Cover Tutorial" is a tutorial about a cover, not a cover.
7. **A decisive non-music category** → video: Film & Animation, Gaming, News, Sports, Education…
   then **music vocabulary** → song: VEVO/label channels, lyrics / instrumental / remix /
   live-performance / official-audio wording.
8. **Weak evidence** — an `Artist - Track`-shaped title — is accepted only for ordinary videos of
   unknown category, never for shorts, sub-90-second clips, `#shorts`-tagged titles, three-part
   clip captions (`Blade II | Sewers of the Damned | ClipZone…`), **never above 8 minutes** without
   a positive music signal, and never when a known category said not-music. The long-form gate
   matters as much as the short one: a 45-minute podcast titled `Host - Guest Name` is not a song.
9. **No evidence at all** → **video**. (Revised from the original song-default: two days of field
   data showed every default-song hit was a news clip, movie scene or vlog. Real music virtually
   always carries a signal above — and MusicBrainz is the safety net for untagged uploads.)
