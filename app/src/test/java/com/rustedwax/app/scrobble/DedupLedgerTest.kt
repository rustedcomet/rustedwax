 * pure — and it is now the shared contract between two code paths (the
 * automatic finalize and the Now card's manual button), so the pairs that must
 * and must not collide are worth pinning.
 *
 * The on-chain duplicates of 2026-07-24/25 were not a key defect — the manual
 * path simply never consulted the ledger. These guard the key against drifting
