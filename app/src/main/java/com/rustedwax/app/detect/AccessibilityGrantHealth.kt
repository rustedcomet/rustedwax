/**
 * Distinguishes an accessibility grant that was never given from one that was
 * given and has since gone away.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Android removes a crashed accessibility service from
 * `enabled_accessibility_services`. From the app's side that is byte-identical
 * to the user switching it off, so a single boolean cannot tell the two apart —
 * and the honest message for each is completely different.
 *
 * On 2026-08-05 the browser watcher was dropped exactly that way. It stayed off
 * for most of a day, the Settings row said "Off" as though that were a choice,
 * and roughly half that day's YouTube watch history never reached the app.
 * `dumpsys accessibility` listed it under `crashed services`, but nothing the
 * owner could see did.
 *
 * The evidence is therefore "was it ever live", which only a live service can
 * establish and which no crash can retract.
 *
 * ## Why a settle window
 *
 * `PHASE_NATIVE_HISTORY.md` §2.3 records that `accessibility_enabled` reads `0`
 * for a few seconds after an APK install and then returns to `1` on its own,
 * with the services reconnecting. Measured again on 2026-08-05 immediately after
 * `adb install -r`: the flag read `0` while both services were still named in
 * the list, and had settled to `1` seconds later.
 *
 * Without a dwell time this class would therefore shout "this crashed" on every
 * install — the mirror image of the bug it exists to catch, and the fastest way
 * to teach the owner to ignore the one warning that matters. [SETTLE_MS] is the
 * grace before a missing grant is called a drop.
