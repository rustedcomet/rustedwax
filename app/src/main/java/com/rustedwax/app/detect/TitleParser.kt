/**
 * Splits `"Korn - Trash (Official Audio)"` into artist and track.
 *
 * Phase 0 run 2 established this is mandatory, not cosmetic: a browser media
 * session reports `ARTIST` as the *channel* ("KornVEVO") and packs the real
 * artist into the video title. Broadcasting raw would write
 * `artist: "KornVEVO"` to the chain, which matches no desktop scrobble of the
 * same song and poisons per-artist indexes.
 *
 * A minimal port of the YouTube rules from `@web-scrobbler/metadata-filter`
 * plus the extension's `pipeline/normalize`. Upstream's tables are far larger
 * and encode years of edge cases; this covers the common shapes.
 *
 * ## Phase 4: normalize to the original recording (decision D7)
 *
 * Cover, live, instrumental and karaoke markers are now **stripped**, so a
 * guitar cover lands on the same entry as the studio track and play counts
 * accumulate in one place instead of scattering. This is a deliberate
 * divergence from the desktop extension, which keeps them — see PHASE4.md.
 *
 * Two limits worth knowing:
 *
 *  - `(Live)` is stripped; `(Live at Wembley)` is kept, because a group is only
 *    dropped when *every* word in it is a known qualifier and no table can
 *    enumerate venue names. A named live recording surviving is the better
 *    failure anyway.
 *  - `(Remix)` is kept. A remix is a distinct work, usually by a different
 *    artist, so folding it into the original would be wrong rather than tidy.
 *
 * ## Trailing hashtags are stripped too
 *
 * Short-form titles are largely tag runs, and leaving them in the title makes
 * the same clip dedup as a different listen every time its tags change. See
 * [TRAILING_HASHTAGS], and [isHashtagOnly] for the case where the tags are all
 * there is.
