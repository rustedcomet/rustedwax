/**
 * Decides whether a YouTube session is `song` or `video`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Until Phase 4 the decision was two signals wide: `music.youtube.com`, or a
 * VEVO/Topic channel, or an `Artist - Track` title. Everything else became
 * `video`. A reported guitar cover — Japanese-bracket title, ordinary channel
 * name — matched none of them and was indexed as a video despite being music,
 * which is the general shape of the bug: covers, live takes and lyric videos
 * are exactly the music that doesn't look like `Artist - Track`.
 *
 * ## Evidence beats keywords (2026-07-24 field data)
 *
 * A day of real testing produced eleven film clips, trailers and shorts
 * scrobbled as `song`. Fetching their watch pages showed why: four were
 * categorized `Film & Animation` by YouTube itself — a category this class
 * didn't know — and the rest sat in ambiguous categories (`Entertainment`,
 * `People & Blogs`) where the old code fell through to weak heuristics: a `|`
 * or `-` in the title read as "names an artist", or the bare D4 default.
 *
 * So the hierarchy is now explicit:
 *
 *  1. **Category, when known, governs.** `Music` → song. Film/gaming/news →
 *     video. An *ambiguous* category doesn't decide — but it demands
 *     **explicit** music evidence (a cover, lyrics, a VEVO channel), because an
 *     uploader who had a Music category available and didn't pick it is weak
 *     evidence against, and a dash in the title is no rebuttal.
 *  2. **Short-form is held to the same higher bar.** Shorts are rapid-fire
 *     browsing; one wrong default per scroll session ruins a playlist. And
 *     almost no real song is under 90 seconds.
 *  3. Keyword lists remain as the **offline fallback only** — for when
 *     enrichment is off or the fetch failed.
 *  4. **A title naming no track can't be a song**, whatever the category says.
 *     Hashtag-only titles are common in short form and were producing
 *     untitled `song` entries.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate and matches how the data is used: a missed song
 * is one lost playlist entry; a false song is permanent playlist pollution the
 * user has to curate away by hand, forever, on an immutable chain.
 *
 * ## Ordering matters
 *
 * Classification must run on the **raw** title, before [TitleParser.clean].
 * "Cover", "live" and "lyrics" are the strongest music signals available, and
 * cleaning strips exactly those words under D7. Classify first, then clean.
