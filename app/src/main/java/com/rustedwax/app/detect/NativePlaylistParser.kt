/**
 * Pure, structural parser for the native YouTube playlist bar.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Native YouTube publishes no video id anywhere a third-party app can read
 * (`PHASE_NATIVE_PLAYLIST_IDENTITY.md` §1 — MediaSession metadata, queue,
 * session activity, notification, accessibility tree and the exported
 * `MainAppMediaBrowserService` were all measured empty). Open-world search over
 * title/artist/duration cannot be made correct by sharpening the comparison,
 * because duplicate uploads are duration-identical: `Criminal` exists as
 * `4ns8D959YtA` and `VqEbCxg2bNI`, both exactly 273 s.
 *
 * The playlist is the way out. It is a *closed* candidate set, and the watch
 * screen names it.
 *
 * ## The two layouts
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-04 on YouTube 21.30.209. With the queue panel collapsed the
 * bar under the player carries:
 *
 * ```
 * yt:playlist_name  t='Reggaeton 2016,17,18'
 * yt:position       t=' • 61/120'   cd='61 out of 120'
 * ```
 *
 * With the panel expanded the same facts move into the panel header under
 * different ids:
 *
 * ```
 * yt:title     t='Reggaeton 2016,17,18'
 * yt:position  t=' • 1/120'
 * yt:subtitle  t='Jhonny Gutierrez'
 * ```
 *
 * Both are accepted. `yt:position` is the anchor in both, so the capture hands
 * this parser one container subtree per position node and each container is
 * read independently — that keeps the panel header from being confused with the
 * `yt:title` of a queue row.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not read
 *
 * `yt:next_video_title` is **not** a playlist signal: it was observed on an
 * ordinary standalone video as the autoplay up-next hint. Only
 * `playlist_name` / `position` indicate a playlist.
 *
 * The position itself is parsed and reported for the event log, but it must
 * never index into the playlist page. Shuffle is not observable — `selected`,
 * `checked` and `contentDescription` on `yt:shuffle` are byte-identical in both
 * states — and `yt:position` was measured still reading `1/120` while the queue
 * was demonstrably shuffled. Resolution is closed-set matching only.
 */
/**
 * Bounded capture of the playlist bar, plus whether an expanded watch screen was
 * on screen at all.
 *
 * [watchScreenPresent] is `com.google.android.youtube:id/watch_panel`, which
 * measured **present on every real watch screen** — playlist or standalone,
 * scrolled or not — and **absent in the miniplayer**, where `watch_player` and
 * `player_view` are still present and therefore useless as a discriminator.
