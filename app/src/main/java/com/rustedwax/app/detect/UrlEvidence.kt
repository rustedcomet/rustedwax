/**
 * What the browser's address bar last said, per browser package.
 *
 * The strongest evidence available: it names the origin exactly instead of
 * inferring it, and when the full URL is exposed it carries the video id — the
 * preferred exact route to the payload hyperlink and enrichment. Finalization
 * can also recover an id from playlist/search evidence when the bar stays bare.
 *
 * Three limits are baked into how this is consumed, not bolted on:
 *
 *  1. It describes the **foreground tab**, which is not necessarily the tab
 *     that's playing. Background-tab audio is normal on YouTube.
 *  2. Screen off means no accessibility events, so it goes stale silently.
 *     Hence [FRESH_MS] — an old reading is discarded, never trusted.
 *  3. It's optional. With the service off this stays empty and identity falls
 *     back to notification hints (decision D6).
