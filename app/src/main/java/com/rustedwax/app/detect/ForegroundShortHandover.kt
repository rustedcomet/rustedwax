/**
 * Whether the Short taking over the player is the item the MediaSession was
 * already describing.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists for
 *
 * When the foreground Shorts route acquires a Short it takes ownership of the
 * player, and `SessionProbe.Watch` hides its own MediaSession so the same
 * seconds are not counted twice. Until v0.9.13 hiding it also *deleted*
 * whatever that session had accumulated, with no finalization — so a video
 * watched to the end and then followed by a Short simply vanished. Measured
 * 2026-08-07 on the owner's device:
 *
 * ```
 * 14:22:54  played=85778ms                    ← THE RUN, 104s long: 82%
 * 14:22:56  MediaSession hidden while complete foreground Shorts proof is active
 * 14:22:56  foreground Short proof acquired: "These singers crossed the line…"
 * ```
 *
 * No finalize line for the trailer exists anywhere after it. The same log holds
 * ten of these, including 168 seconds of a Caifanes song and 163 of an HBO
 * trailer.
 *
 * Progress earned before the hand-off belongs to whatever the session was
 * playing, and that has to be scored rather than discarded — *unless* the Short
 * taking over is that same item, in which case the foreground route is about to
 * score it and finalizing here would double-count it.
 *
 * ## Why a separate object
 *
 * `Watch` owns a `MediaController` and can't be unit-tested; this predicate is
 * pure, so it lives where a test can reach it — the same split
 * [TrackProgressCarry] exists for.
