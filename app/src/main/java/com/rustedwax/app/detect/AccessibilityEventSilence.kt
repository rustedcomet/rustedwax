/**
 * Names the outage that `FIELD_2026-08-05.md` §5.1 could only infer from gaps.
 *
 * ## The bug this instruments
 *
 * Between 17:19:40 and 17:21:07 on 2026-08-05 the log held two lines, 30s apart
 * — the idle poll and nothing else — while a Short was playing. The Shorts
 * observer had received no YouTube accessibility event for 87 seconds. In the
 * same session a Short titled `💯💯💯🔥😎` never appears in the log at all:
 * never observed, never finalized. It is the same shape as the earlier 13h
 * outage, it explains the regular-mode Shorts that did not scrobble, and it is
 * very likely why roughly half that day's watch history never reached the app.
 *
 * At hand-off the service looked healthy — `crashed services: {}` empty, both
 * grants on, standby bucket 10 — so it is intermittent and cannot be reproduced
 * on demand. Hunting a cause that only appears by surprise, from evidence that
 * only exists as an absence of lines, is how the 13h outage went unexplained.
 * So this measures it first: the next occurrence writes its own name, its own
 * duration and what was on screen at the time.
 *
 * ## What the first field day proved about this detector, 2026-08-06
 *
 * It reported **111 outages in one day**, median 111 seconds. Almost none were
 * real, and two measurements killed the design that produced them.
 *
 * **Event silence is not observer silence.** At 15:08:39 it reported
 * `silent for 45s … (Shorts player on screen) — anything played in this window
 * is unobserved` while, inside that exact window, the service had measured the
 * seekbar thirteen times and credited forty seconds. Once a Short is latched the
 * observer stops needing callbacks and polls on its own second, so *events* stop
 * while *observation* continues perfectly. A successful capture is therefore
 * liveness, and the only liveness that matters.
 *
 * **`YOUTUBE_NO_PLAYER` is usually the user leaving Shorts.** Reproduced on
 * demand, first try: press Back out of the Shorts player and YouTube keeps
 * `reel_time_bar` in its hierarchy while `reel_watch_fragment_root` stops being
 * visible, so every capture reads `found 0; captured 2 nodes`. 36% of the day's
 * captures were that shape. It is the app being open and idle, not an outage.
 *
 * ## The evidence that a report actually needs
 *
 * The report has to answer "is something playing that we cannot see?", and the
 * accessibility tree cannot answer it — measured 2026-08-06, while a Short plays
 * YouTube's MediaSession is `active=false`, `state=1`, `metadata: size=0`. It
 * says nothing about Shorts at all, so asking it would be circular.
 *
 * The independent answer already exists, built for picture-in-picture (§8.3):
 * media audio in the `started` state paired with a YouTube window that
 * `UsageStatsManager` reports visible. That pair is what [PipPlaybackProbe]
 * answers, and it is true exactly when a listen is being lost.
 *
 * So a report now requires the screen on, the surface not to be another app, no
 * successful capture within the window — and evidence that something is playing
 * that **nothing else is already counting**. Ordinary watch playback is measured
 * by the MediaSession, and picture-in-picture time is credited by its own
 * inference; neither is a loss, so neither reports. When Usage Access is missing
 * the question cannot be answered at all, and only [ObservedSurface.NO_ROOT] —
 * the state where the service cannot see anything — still reports on its own.
 *
 * A paused Short left on screen no longer reports at all: paused audio drops out
 * of the started list, which is the same property the PiP inference relies on.
 *
 * ## Reporting-only
 *
 * Nothing here changes a scrobble decision, a capture, or any gate. It observes
 * and it writes lines.
