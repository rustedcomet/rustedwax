/**
 * Site hints harvested from browser media notifications.
 *
 * Phase 0 measured that Chromium browsers publish artwork as an embedded
 * *bitmap* and populate no URI keys at all — so the media session alone cannot
 * tell us which site is playing (see PHASE0.md, Q3).
 *
 * The media *notification* is the second source. Chromium renders a
 * media-style notification whose sub-text is the page origin ("youtube.com"),
 * which is exactly the missing piece. This holder is written by
 * [RustedWaxListenerService] and read by [SessionProbe].
 *
 * ## Why hints are a list, not a single value
 *
 * Phase 4 found the original design — one hint per package, last write wins —
 * misattributes as soon as two browser tabs have audio. Brave gets one slot, so
 * a YouTube session could inherit another site's origin (skipping a legitimate
 * scrobble) or, worse, a non-YouTube session could inherit `youtube.com` and be
 * broadcast as YouTube. Removing one tab's notification also wiped the
 * surviving tab's evidence.
 *
 * So hints are kept as a short per-package history and **bound to a session**
 * by [bestFor], which matches on the media title. Chromium builds the
 * notification title and the media session's `METADATA_KEY_TITLE` from the same
 * page metadata, so equality there is strong evidence the two describe the same
 * playback.
 *
 * Scope discipline: only notifications from the browser packages we target are
 * ever inspected, and only the fields describing the playing media. Nothing
 * else is read, stored, or logged.
