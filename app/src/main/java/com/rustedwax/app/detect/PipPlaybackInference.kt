/**
 * Wall-clock credit for a Short whose seekbar has gone away, while evidence
 * still says it is playing.
 *
 * ## Why this is inference and not measurement
 *
 * In picture-in-picture YouTube publishes no progress at all: no `SeekBar` under
 * `reel_time_bar`, no time text in the window, and a MediaSession reporting
 * `STATE_NONE` with `position=0` (`FIELD_2026-08-05.md` §4.1). Every direct
 * source is gone, so the only honest options are to credit nothing or to credit
 * elapsed time on evidence that playback is continuing. This does the latter,
 * and says so in every line it produces.
 *
 * ## What the evidence is, and why it takes two signals
 *
 * `AudioManager.getActivePlaybackConfigurations()` is public and tells us
 * whether *some* app has `USAGE_MEDIA` audio started. It cannot say whose:
 * `AudioPlaybackConfiguration` exposes only `getAudioAttributes()` and
 * `getAudioDeviceInfo()` to a normal app, and the framework hands out anonymized
 * copies with the client uid stripped. On its own it would credit another app's
 * podcast to a YouTube Short.
 *
 * `UsageStatsManager` supplies the missing half. It names packages, and a PiP
 * window keeps YouTube's activity `ACTIVITY_RESUMED`/`ACTIVITY_PAUSED` rather
 * than `ACTIVITY_STOPPED`, so "YouTube still has a visible window" is
 * attributable in a way the audio list is not.
 *
 * Neither alone is enough. Together they mean *YouTube is on screen and media
 * audio is playing*, which is as close to "this Short is playing" as the public
 * API allows. The residual false positive is stated plainly: another app playing
 * audio while a YouTube PiP window sits paused looks identical, and would be
 * credited. That is the accepted cost of counting PiP at all.
 *
 * ## The caps, which are not optional
 *
 * - Credit only advances between two consecutive observations that *both* say
 *   playing, so a gap in polling cannot be back-filled.
 * - A single step is capped at [MAX_STEP_MS]. A process frozen for ten minutes
 *   and then resumed must not wake up and credit ten minutes.
 * - Total credit is capped so measured + inferred can never exceed the Short's
 *   own duration. Shorts auto-loop, and without this a Short left in PiP would
 *   accumulate credit forever and reach any threshold.
 *
 * Speed is assumed to be 1×. There is no public signal for playback rate here,
 * and the assumption is recorded rather than hidden.
