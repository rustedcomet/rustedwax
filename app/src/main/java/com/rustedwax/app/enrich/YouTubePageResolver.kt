/**
 * Reads a video's own metadata off its watch page.
 *
 * Chromium publishes no video id to the media session (PHASE0 Q3), so this can
 * only run once browser evidence or finalization recovery has obtained one.
 * Given an id, the watch page carries what the media session can't: YouTube's own **category** —
 * which answers `song` vs `video` far better than any title heuristic — plus
 * the description, where cover uploads routinely credit the original artist.
 *
 * ## This is the fragile part of Phase 4 (decision D8)
 *
 * `ytInitialPlayerResponse` is an undocumented blob in a page nobody promised
 * would keep its shape. The mitigations are not optional:
 *
 *  - Every extraction failure logs a **distinct** line, so breakage reads
 *    differently from "this video had nothing to add". Silent degradation here
 *    would look exactly like enrichment being switched off.
 *  - The parsing lives in [WatchPageParser], which is pure and unit-tested
 *    against a page fixture, so drift fails a test rather than a scrobble.
 *  - Everything is behind [MetadataResolver], so a Data-API implementation
 *    replaces it without touching the pipeline.
 *  - Nothing throws, nothing blocks past [TIMEOUT_MS], and a failure always
 *    falls back to the offline parse.
 *
 * ## What this sends
 *
 * One GET to youtube.com per new video, carrying the video id, from outside the
 * browser. Google already knows you watched it; the app is not telling them
 * anything new. It is still off-device traffic, so it stays a visible setting.
