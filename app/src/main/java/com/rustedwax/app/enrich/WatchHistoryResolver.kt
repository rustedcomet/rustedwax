/**
 * Resolves an exact video id from the signed-in account's watch history.
 *
 * The route of last resort before search, and the only one that answers for
 * native playback outside a playlist — backgrounded, screen off, or a single
 * video with no queue around it (`PHASE_NATIVE_PLAYLIST_IDENTITY.md` §10.3).
 *
 * Resolution priority, unchanged elsewhere:
 * `browser address bar → playlist entry set → watch history → search`.
 * The playlist stays ahead because it is one fetch serving a hundred tracks and
 * needs no credentials; history covers what the playlist cannot.
 *
 * ## Handling of the session
 *
 * The cookie is read from [YouTubeSessionVault] at the moment of the request
 * and attached to exactly one hardcoded origin. It is never logged, never
 * placed in an event, never returned to a caller, and never attached to a
 * redirect — redirects are not followed at all, precisely so a 302 cannot walk
 * the credential to another host. Cookie rotations that YouTube sends back are
 * folded into the vault so a live session is not allowed to expire on disk.
