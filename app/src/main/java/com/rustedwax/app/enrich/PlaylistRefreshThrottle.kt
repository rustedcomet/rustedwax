/**
 * Bounds how often a playlist is re-fetched after a track failed to match it.
 *
 * ## Why a refresh is needed at all
 *
 * A playlist is fetched once and its entries serve every track in it — that is
 * what makes native identity cheap (§4 of `PHASE_NATIVE_PLAYLIST_IDENTITY.md`).
 * The cost is staleness: until v0.9.6 the entry list was never re-read, so a
 * song added to the playlist *after* the first fetch could not be found again
 * for the entire life of the process, and every play of it fell through to the
 * search route that has been measured picking the wrong upload.
 *
 * ## Why it has to be throttled
 *
 * A miss is not evidence of staleness. The commonest miss by far is a track
 * that is legitimately not in the playlist — autoplay carrying on past the last
 * entry, or the stale-but-harmless latch of §6.3 still naming the playlist the
 * user has left. Refreshing on every miss would re-download the playlist page
 * once per track for the rest of that listening session.
 *
 * So: a refresh is allowed only when the cached copy is already older than
 * [minIntervalMs], no more than [maxRefreshes] refreshes have been spent on
 * that playlist in this process, and the previous attempt is itself older than
 * [minIntervalMs]. A newly fetched playlist is therefore never re-fetched on
 * the very next track, and the worst case for a playlist RustedWax keeps
 * missing is a small fixed number of extra page loads.
