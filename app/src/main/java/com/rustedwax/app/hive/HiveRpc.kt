	 * legitimately fire for operations minutes apart, and the symptom that gave
	 * the stall away: the node's block never advanced, so the five stuck
	 * operations were forever "this block".
	 *
	 * A freshness check ([chainLagSeconds]) would have skipped that node, and does
	 * now. But no liveness check can cover every way a node can misbehave, so
	 * success is confirmed against a *different* node than the one that accepted

	 *
	 * ## What counts as confirmed, and why mempool does
	 *
	 * The question being asked is **"does any healthy node other than the one
	 * that accepted it know this transaction exists?"** That is the check the
	 * frozen node failed: it held five
	 * transactions in a pending block it would never produce, and no other node
	 * had ever heard of them, so every healthy node answers `unknown`.
	 *
	 * So `within_mempool` on the last attempt counts as independently observed,
	 * but it is not labelled as block inclusion. A transaction that is relaying
	 * and alive will almost always land in the next block or
	 * two, and the alternative is worse in a specific way: reporting failure
	 * queues it, the retry rebuilds it with a fresh expiration and therefore a new
	 * id, and if the original *did* land the result is a duplicate on a chain that
	 * cannot be edited. A missed entry can be earned again by watching. A
	 * duplicate is permanent. On ambiguity, don't retry.
