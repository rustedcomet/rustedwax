/**
 * Checks a typed-in posting key against the account's on-chain authority.
 *
 * This is the local-signing equivalent of the extension's Keychain login: the
 * extension proved account ownership by having Keychain sign a challenge, then
 * verified the recovered public key against `posting.key_auths`
 * (`posting-key-verify.ts`). Holding the key outright, we skip the signature
 * round-trip and compare the derived public key directly — same guarantee,
 * fewer moving parts.
 *
 * Fails closed, exactly as upstream does: any parse or network problem is a
 * rejection, never an "assume it's fine".
