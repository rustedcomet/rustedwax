/**
 * Video ids the user has told the app never to scrobble again.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * There are two kinds of advertisement in the YouTube Shorts feed, and only one
 * is detectable. A dedicated ad creative is **unlisted**, which
 * [com.rustedwax.app.enrich.VideoFacts.isUnlisted] catches. The other kind is an
 * ordinary *public* video on a brand channel that YouTube promoted — verified
 * 2026-07-29, when `PONDS CAM — Consigue tu rutina ahora.` reached the chain:
 *
 * ```
 *                   POND'S (leaked)   Susy Mouriz (organic)
 *   unlisted        false             false
 *   isCrawlable     true              true
 *   noindex         false             false
 *   viewCount       1,138,564         20,886,671
 * ```
 *
 * Every field in the player response is the same, including
 * `adBreakHeartbeatParams`, `paid` and `playabilityStatus`. They are the same
 * because the promoted video **is** ordinary content — the identical video could
 * have reached the feed organically. No signal available to a media-session
 * observer separates them, so no rule can.
 *
 * What is left is the user's own judgement, applied once. Muting an id can't
 * unwrite what is already on-chain — nothing can — but a promoted video that
 * comes round the feed again won't scrobble a second time.
 *
 * ## Not a dedup ledger
 *
 * [com.rustedwax.app.scrobble.DedupLedger] answers "has this *listen* already
 * been written", is keyed by title and hour, and prunes after six hours. This
 * answers "is this *video* unwanted, ever", is keyed by video id, and never
 * expires. Different questions, so a separate store.
